Installing and running Trefor under Unix/Linux

If you got somewhere the file ctrf.tar.gz
then ungzip and untar it, e.g.

      gtar -xzvf ctrf.tar.gz

or if that does not work

      gzip -d ctrf.tar.gz

      tar -xvf ctrf.tar

Now issue commands

      make conf

      make all

      make clean

When you are prompted type ``Y'' if it goes OK.

Instead of 

     make all

issue

     make all95

to get trefor95 which is more suitable for producing f90 and f95 compatible fortran
files.    

Now you have 2 binary executables: trf* and trefor* (and/or trefor95*) -- put them
to your executable  path (e.g. /usr/local/bin, or  local $HOME/bin/
directory) or work with Trefor in the same directory
you have them currently. 

The execution of trf command is controlled by the .trfrc file. Read it
carefully and edit it to connect trf execution with the default COMPILER
(and compiler's options) and the default EDITOR that you wish to use. 
The trf command looks for .trfrc file in the current directory, and
if it is not found there then in the system directories (/usr/local/lib
etc.). If .trfrc is not found at all then internal default options
are used. You should have last definition of TREFOR variable in .trfrc
like

TREFOR=trefor95 %t . 1 

if you want to use trefor95 instead of the default trefor

The Trefor
options are explained there in .trfrc file, or you may type

      trf

and you will see the list of the options.

E.g.,

      trf -nf your\_code.trf

(where -nf means No Fortran compilation) 
will not submit your code to the Fortran compiler (defined in .trfrc
file).

If you wish to submit your code to Fortran compilation, then type, e.g.,

      trf - -c -O -qarch=pwr2 your\_code.trf

Here you do not define any Trefor options and
`` -c -O '' etc. --  they are your Fortran options.

If you type

      trf -e your\_code.trf

then you open your\_code.trf file for editing with the EDITOR -- this
happens only if a severe error occured at the stage of Trefor preprocessing.

All needed Trefor options are written in one group, e.g.,

      trf -nfl your\_code.trf

-- no fortran compilation and preservation of the Trefor listing 
(your\_code.lst) file.

Now copy
  cp trefor/.trfrc ~/
  sudo cp trefor.xml /usr/share/kde4/apps/katepart/syntax/trefor.xml
and move:
  sudo mv bin/trf bin/trefor bin/trefor95 /usr/local/bin/
and you are done.

Use, e.g. 

    a2ps -p [-Pprinter] your\_code.lst

command to printout Trefor listings.
